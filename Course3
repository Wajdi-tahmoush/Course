Algorithm Analysis
understand performance and colmplexity of algorithm and analyse to acheive most optimality. 
Performance: How much time/memory/disk/etc. is used when a program is run. An Optimal code should consume the minimum possible.
Complexity: How do the resource requirements of a program or algorithm scale, i.e. what happens as the size of the problem being solved by the code gets larger. Again an optimal agorithm should minimize resources requirments.
